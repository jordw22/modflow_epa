- **Storage coefficient** (_See also_ Storage): For surface waters such as a reservoir, a coefficient expressing the relationship of the surface area to the mean annual flow that supplies it. For an aquifer, 
  the volume of water released from storage in a vertical column of 1 sq ft when the water table or other piezometric surface declines 1 ft. In an unconfined aquifer, it is approximately equal to the 
  specific yield (Gary).

  but clearly defined channel on the surface of the ground, in a subterranean cavern, or beneath or in a glacier; especially such a body flowing in a natural channel. It is a mixture of water and of 
  dissolved, suspended, or entrained matter. A term popularly applied to a brook or to a small river. The water flowing in a stream (Gary).

- **Stress period**: A period in which all the stresses (boundary conditions, pumping rates, etc.) on the system are constant ("Stress").
- **Surface water**: All water on the surface of the Earth, including fresh and salt water, ice and snow (Gary).

## T
-----------------------------------------------

- **Target zone**: A regional area, normally with regional geological structures where potential boreholes can be sited. Infrastructure for these potential boreholes must be available ("The Groundwater").
- **Temporal** (_See also_ Discretization): A process of converting general time series into discrete values that apply over specific time ranges (stress periods) ("GMS:Temporal").
- **Tensor**: To compute the tensor product of something with something else. A function of several variables which is a product of many functions of one variable, one for each variable, 
  each of which is linear in that variable ("The Web's").
- **Theis solution**: Predicts drawdown in a confined aquifer at any distance from a well at any time since the start of pumping given the aquifer properties, transmissivity, and storage coefficient (Gary).
- **Thickness** (_See also_ Layer): The extent of a tabular unit from its bottom boundary surface to its top surface, usually measured along a line normal to these bounding surfaces (Gary).
- **Time step**: A series of statistical data collected at regular intervals of time; a frequency distribution in which the independent variable is time (Gary).
- **Time step multiplier**: Is the factor used to increment each time step size within each stress period (it is the ratio of the value of each time step to that of the preceding time step). 
  A value greater than 1 will produce smaller time steps at the beginning of a stress period resulting in a better representation of the changes of the transient flow field. Thus increasing 
  the number of time steps in a simulation may result in smoother head or drawdown versus time curves ("Stress").
- **Transient** (_See also_ Calibration): Remaining for only a brief time. Passing or disappearing with time ("The Web's").
- **Transmissivity**: In an aquifer, the rate at which water of the prevailing kinematic viscosity is transmitted through a unit width under a unit hydraulic gradient. 
  Though spoken of as a property of the aquifer, it embodies also the saturated thickness and the properties of the contained liquid (Gary).

## U
-----------------------------------------------

- **Unconfined** (_See also_ Aquifer, Layer): An aquifer where the water table is the upper boundary and with no confining layer between the water table and the ground surface. 
  The water table is free to fluctuate up and down ("The Groundwater"). An aquifer having a water table; an aquifer containing unconfined ground water (Gary).
- **Unconfined groundwater**: Ground water that has a free water table; water not confined under pressure beneath relatively impermeable rocks (Gary).
- **Underflow**: The movement of ground water in an underflow conduit; the flow of water through the soil or a subsurface stratum, or under a structure. 
  The rate of discharge of ground water through an underflow conduit. The water flowing beneath the bed or alluvial plain of a surface stream, 
  generally, in the same direction as, but at a much slower rate than, the surface drainage; especially the water flowing under a dry stream channel in an arid region (Gary).
- **Uniform flow**: Flow of a current of water in which there is neither convergence nor divergence (Gary).
- **Unsaturated zone**: A subsurface zone containing water under pressure less than that of the atmosphere, including water held by capillarity; and containing air or 
  gases generally under surface and below by the surface of the zone of saturation (Gary).

## V
-----------------------------------------------

- **Variable density flow**: The flow of water that possesses characteristics of varying density over time.
- **Variably saturated flow**: The changing amounts of saturation present in the ground in a certain area over time.
- **Variance**: The square of the standard deviation.
- **Vertical flow** (_See also_ Confining bed): The flow of water in a vertical direction.
- **Vertical hydraulic conductivity** (_See also_ Confining bed, Conductance, Layer): The conductance in a vertically flowing body of water (referred to as VCONT); 
  focuses on defining leakance rather than conductance ("Inside").

## W
-----------------------------------------------

- **Water budget**: hydraulic budget
- **Water table**: The surface between the zone of saturation and the zone of aeration; that surface of a body of unconfined ground water at which the pressure is equal to that of the atmosphere (Gary).
- **Well** (_See also_ Capture zone): An artificial excavation (pit, hole, tunnel), generally cylindrical in form and often walled in, sunk (drilled, dug, driven, bored, or jetted) into the ground
  to such a depth as to penetrate water-yielding rock or soil and to allow the water to flow or to be pumped to the surface; a water well. A term originally applied to a natural spring or 
  to a pool formed by or fed from a spring; especially a mineral spring (Gary).
